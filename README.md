I'm new to Calgary and can't figure out how to make good cookies :(
They taste fine, but are always too crumbly. I've tried using a higher oven temperature to compensate for the altitude, and reducing the amount of baking soda...it's helped, but they're not the crispy-chewy gems that I used to bake up back in Ottawa.
